Hand Gesture Recognition using CNN (LeapGestRecog Dataset)
This project implements a hand gesture recognition system using deep learning (CNN with transfer learning).
It uses the LeapGestRecog dataset consisting of 200,000 images across 10 different gesture classes, collected using a Leap Motion Controller.
